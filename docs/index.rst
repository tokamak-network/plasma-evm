Plasma EVM provides a EVM-compatitable plasma chain with scalability and security. `Plasma <http://plasma.io/>`_ is scalability solution for Ethereum, making layered blockchains that data in child chain is summarized and committed to root chain.

Plasma EVM can reuse any solutions and framworks on Ethereum like Soldiity, Truffle, Metamask, and even MyEtherWallet.

The major differences from other plasma proposals are as follows:

* Account-based blockchain
* Supports EVM computation
* Supports global state for a single transaction

You can follow how this design came out from scratch :doc:`here <design>`.
